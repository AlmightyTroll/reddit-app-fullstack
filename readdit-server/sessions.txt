req.session!.userId = user.id

{userId: 1} ---> send that to redis 

- redis is a key value store : you have a key to look up values.

1
sess:flsdflsdfjd -> {userId: 1}

2
- the express-session will set a cookie on the browser fndnfsd;fnsdlfnwel;f
    - this cookie is a signed value of the sess:flsdhfls key.

3
when the user makes a request:
fndnfsd;fnsdlfnwel;f --> value will be sent to the server.

4
fndnfsd;fnsdlfnwel;f  value  is unsigned (decrypt) by the secrete we created in the index.ts app.use(session({}))
it is turned into the sess:flsdflsdfjd
- fndnfsd;fnsdlfnwel;f --> sess:flsdflsdfjd

5 
make a request ot redis
looks up key --> sess:flsdflsdfjd in redis.
gets the data {userId: 1}
- sess:flsdflsdfjd -> {userId: 1}

6 stores the data recieved {userId: 1} on req.session
- req.session = {userId: 1}
